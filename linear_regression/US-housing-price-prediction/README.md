# Linear Regression with Python for prediction the USA house price


In this project we will be analyzing and predict housing prices for regions in the USA.

The code is in the lin_reg_usa_house.ipynb file.
The data is in data/USA_Housing.csv

## DataInfo
Date Set: USA_Housing.csv
The data contains the following columns:


* 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.
* 'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in same city
* 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city
* 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
* 'Area Population': Population of city house is located in
* 'Price': Price that the house sold at
* 'Address': Address for the house

## Objectives
### Analyse the data and get below insights
- Compare the performance of Random Forest with Decision Tree
- Predict and evaluate the performance.
- Comparing these metrics:
    - MAE is the easiest to understand, because it's the average error.
    - MSE is more popular than MAE, because MSE "punishes" larger errors, which tends to be useful in the real world.
    - RMSE is even more popular than MSE, because RMSE is interpretable in the "y" units.




## Tech Stack
- **Python modlues**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn and matplotlib.
- **SK Learn Modlues**:  LinearRegression, metrics and train_test_split.
- **Plots**: pairplot, distplot, and heatmap.
