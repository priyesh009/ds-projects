# Linear Regression on Ecommerce Data

In this project we will be analyzing and performing linear regression on ecommerce Data.
The code is in the linear_reg_ecomm.ipynb file.
The data is in **data/Ecommerce Customers**

## DataInfo

- Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
- Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
- Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes

## Objectives
### Analyse the data and get below insights
- Try to understand whether Ecomm company should focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
- Predict and evaluate the performance.


## Tech Stack
- **Python modlues**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn and matplotlib.
- **SK Learn Modlues**: LinearRegression, metrics and train_test_split.
- **Plots**: pairplot, jointplot and lmplot.
