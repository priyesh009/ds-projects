# Using decision Trees and random forest on Kyphosis patient


In this project we will be analyzing and predict Kyphosis patient data Using decision Trees and random forest.

The code is in the decision_tress_on_kyphosis_patients.ipynb file.
The data is in data/kyphosis.csv

## Objectives
### Analyse the data and get below insights
- Compare the performance of Random Forest with Decision Tree
- Predict and evaluate the performance.


## Tech Stack
- **Python modlues**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn and matplotlib.
- **SK Learn Modlues**: RandomForestClassifier and DecisionTreeClassifier
- **Plots**: pairplot()

## dataInfo
* Age is in months
* Number is number of vertebrae involved
* Start is the number of the top most vertebrae operated on.
