# Using K Nearest Neighbors with Python


In this project we will be working with classified data set from a company! It has hidden the feature column names but have given the data and the target classes.

We'll try to use KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features.

The code is in the KNN_with_classified_data.ipynb file.
The data is in **data/Classified Data**

## Objectives
### Analyse the data and get below insights
- Identifying the apt model to predict whether someone will be in the TARGET CLASS or not.
- Identifying the apt value of 'k'.
- Visulization of the error rate with K value.
- Predict and evaluate the performance.


## Tech Stack
- **Python modlues**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn and matplotlib.
- **SK Learn Modlues**: preprocessing.StandardScaler, train_test_split, metrics, and KNeighborsClassifier
- **Plots**: plot()

## dataInfo
* It is a classified data
* It has 10 features and one column for the Class Type
