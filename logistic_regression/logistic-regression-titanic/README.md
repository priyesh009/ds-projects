# Logistic Regression with Python for the Titanic data


In this project we will be analyzing and predict a classification- survival or deceased using Logistic Regression.

The code is in the logistic_regression_titanic.ipynb file.
The data is in data/titanic_train.csv Or [Titanic Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Objectives
### Analyse the data and get below insights
- To predict a classification- survival or deceased. 
- Perform exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and handle missing data.
- Predict and evaluate the performance of the model.
- Convert categorical features to dummy variables using pandas.



## Tech Stack
- **Python modlues**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn and matplotlib.
- **SK Learn Modlues**: train_test_split,LogisticRegression, metrics.classification_report and metric.confusion_matrix
- **Plots**: distplot, heatmap, boxplot, and countplot


## Pending Enhancements
* Explore other feature engineering and the other titanic_text.csv file
* Try get_dummies on the Pclass column
* Try grabbing the Title (Dr.,Mr.,Mrs,etc..) from the name as a feature
* Maybe the Cabin letter could be a feature
* Is there any info we can get from the ticket?
